# Overview

The archer specialized in the branch of Plume Monarch focuses on physical damage, specifically damage through combos.
Their strength lies in PvE content, especially from evolving to Arrowgod (level 100).

<br />
<br />

# Evolutions

```
1. Archer
1. Wind Crossbower
2. Dual Crossbower
3. Arrowgod
4. Plume Monarch
```

<br />
<br />

# Stat Priority

Since the damage of this specialization is based on combo damage, our main focus will be to increase our probability of executing a combo hit and, if possible, also increase critical hit chance.
Therefore, our ideal combination of bonuses in equipment would be Combo and Critical.
Evasion will be a good option in case we cannot obtain one of these bonuses. The priority of bonuses we will seek is as follows:

```
1. Combo + Critic
2. Combo + Evasion
3. Critic + Evasion
4. Combo + Anything
5. Critic + Anything
6. What ever
```

<br />
<br />

# Recommended Skills

Skills play a significant role in configuring our character. We can create a set of base skills on which we can make small adjustments and tailor them to our needs at any given moment, but it will be up to us to understand how these skills work and experiment when we get stuck.
As we unlock higher-ranked skills, we will need to replace the ones we had before, so examples of skills will be given for an early phase of the game and others for when we are more advanced.

# Pals

For pals, like with skills, we will look for a combination that enhances our strong point, which is attacking very quickly to perform many combos, but we cannot neglect a crucial aspect which is survival.
Therefore, we should replace pals that enhance our offensive capabilities with others that assist us with survival as we use them. There is no perfect combination for all situations; small changes are necessary to adapt to the situation.

# Relic

Relics are highly situational, and the choice we make regarding them will generally depend on the skills or pals we have.

<br />

#### Mask
```
PvE/PvP: Arrow King Mask (Combo +10%)
```

<br />

#### Fossil
```
PvE/PvP: Thundercaller Kite (After using active skills, summon lightning dealing DMG)
```

<br />

#### Treasure
```
PvE/PvP: Blessed Dew (Increase Cactus Pal's Combo Rate)
PvE/PvP: Magic Box (Increase Cat and Deer Pal's DMG)
PvE/PvP: Metamorphic Crystal (Increase the attack speed of Dog, Fox and Octupus Pals)
```

<br />

#### Book
```
PvP: Flame Book (At the start of the battle, increase ATK by 1% per second, up to 10%)
PvE: Beasthide Book (Increase DMG dealt to Bosses by 20%)
PvE: Immunity Book (In Boss levels, become immmune to DMG for 3 seconds when HP drops bellow 70% for the first time)
```

<br />

#### Statue
```
PvE/PvP: Cage Statue (Boost the effects of Durian Bomb, Easy Breezy and Take It Slow by 30%)
PvE/PvP: Tie Statue (Extend the effect duration of Disarm, Dazzler and Smoke Bomb by 50%)
```

<br />

#### Necklace
```
PvE/PvP: Storm Necklace (Increase the DMG of sumoned units by 30% during Heroic Descent and Close Strike)
PvE/PvP: Spirit Necklace (Basic attacks deal and extra 15% DMG during BLitz Assault)
```

<br />
<br />

# Statue

Here we will always look for offensive statistics, accumulating several combo ones if possible.
Some possible combinations we could make are as follows:

```
Option 1: Global combo damage x4 + Critical x1
Option 2: Global combo damage x3 + Critical x2
```

<br />
<br />

# TL;DR

Best class for PvE content at level 100+. Priorize combo and then critic. Skills and pets that boost ur damage/attack speed and allow you to survive enemy burst.
