# Introduction to Mining
Mining is a very important part of the game, as it will be the main source of mineral income.
We will use minerals to carry out the __[research at the Science and Technology Center](https://lom-academy.com/guides/progression/tech)__.

<br/>

## Types of Tools
To excavate for minerals, we have three types of tools: pickaxes, drills, and bombs.

<br/>

With each pickaxe, we can break one block, unless it is a stone, in which case we will need two pickaxes to break it.

With the drill and bombs, we won't have the problem of stones, as they will break everything within their range.

The drill will be useful for situations where we mainly want to destroy blocks vertically.

The bomb, on the other hand, allows us to remove blocks in an area around it.

## Obtaining Tools

We will recover pickaxes over time, although we can also obtain some through other methods.

However, drills and bombs must be obtained by finding them while excavating, buying them in the clan store, or watching an ad (2 per day).

Additionally, we can obtain more tools through the lucky roulette, daily offers, events, etc.

## Mining Strategy
We must bear in mind that, generally, the deeper we are, the more minerals we will collect.

The rate stops increasing when we reach 9,500 meters, so it is optimal to try to reach this depth as soon as possible.

## Automatic Mining
Upon reaching a depth of 10,000 meters or unlocking the Mining License, we will have access to the automatic mining tool.

This tool has two modes of use, one focused on reaching the maximum depth possible and the other on obtaining the greatest amount of materials.

## Mining License
We can acquire a monthly license that will grant us certain benefits when mining.
- 50% increase in extracted minerals.
- Instant unlocking of automatic mining.
- Increase in maximum pickaxe capacity by 20.
- 30 pickaxes that we can claim daily.
