# Introduction to Mounts
The mount system allow us to ride different kinds of mounts. 
Mounts give us basic attributes such as HP Bonus, ATK Bonus and DEF Bonus bbut it is also our main source of evasion. 
To upgrade our mount we need to use Clock Winders. We can obtain them in Chrono Tower or buying them in the Gem shop mainly.

Empower the mount cost will increase with the level of Empowerment and there is a chance to fail the empower.

# Advance Mounts
Advanced mounts are skins that provide a mount effect and an extra ability.
The mount effect accumulates alongside all the advanced mounts we have unlocked.
The mount ability will only activate if we have the mount in use.
