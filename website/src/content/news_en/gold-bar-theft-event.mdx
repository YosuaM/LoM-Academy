A new event arrives in Legend of Mushroom: The Gold Ingot Robbery. During this event, we'll need to find clues about the gold ingots.

This event will be available from April 12th to April 18th.

Additionally, in light of the event, the developers have released a new gift code: __GOLDMUSH__

# Event Access
To access the event, we need to click on the button that appears on the right side of our screen, the investigator icon.

Inside the event window, we can find its different sections:

## Search of Gold Bar
In this part of the event, we'll face off against other players from our server to obtain clues and other rewards. As we defeat rivals, we'll be allowed to choose an accumulative bonus that we'll enjoy during the event, enabling us to defeat more powerful enemies.

Every day, we can engage in a series of random confrontations. It's important to complete them daily to obtain all the rewards.

## Detective Ranking
Similar to other themed events, there's a ranking where players can vie for a series of rewards based on their placement, which corresponds to the number of clues found during the event.

## Solve Clues
As we solve clues, we'll progress in the event pass. As always, we have free rewards, a small pass for 0.99 gems, and a big pass for 9.99 gems.
Acquiring these passes is interesting because, in addition to the typical rewards we can obtain (hammers, seeds, gems...), we get golden shovels, with which we can play in the lucky spinner.

## Recon Supply
In this section, we'll find different offers that will change every few days. The peculiarity of these offers is that we won't be able to buy them directly for ourselves; we'll need to do it as a group. Pay attention to when the offers are updated as you may find some for diamonds and others for gems, all quite interesting.

__Clarification:__ If we form or join a group to make the purchase and the time runs out without completion, the invested gems or diamonds will be returned to us via in-game mail.

## Find the Culprit
The lucky spinner of this themed event brings us a new costume, artifact, and wings as highlighted items, along with an awakening crystal that will be replaced by Type 1 Red AG Selection when we obtain the crystal.
If you plan to play the spinner, the best way is to acquire the pass, as we'll get a good number of attempts.

## Routine Search
In this section, we'll see a series of daily missions with which we'll obtain clues for the event. They are quite easy to complete, so we should do them every day to get as many rewards as possible.

## Detective Assist
Here we can acquire golden shovels to play more on the spinner.

## Ponder Shop
By playing on the spinner, we'll collect inspiration lamps. These lamps will serve as currency to buy the items in this shop. Among them, the new artifact, the new wings, the new costume, Red AG, and more.
