## Ultimate Duck
Similar to other themed events, there's a ranking where players can vie for a series of rewards based on their placement, which corresponds to the number of Ice Watermelons consumed during the event.


<br/>


## Duck Coastal Tour
As we consume Iced Watermelon, we'll progress in the event pass. As always, we have free rewards, a small pass for 0.99 gems, and a big pass for 9.99 gems.
Acquiring these passes is interesting because, in addition to the typical rewards we can obtain, we get event coins, with which we can play in the lucky spinner.

## B.Duck Slide
The lucky spinner of this themed event brings us a new artifact and new mount as highlighted items, along with an awakening crystal that will be replaced by Type 1 Red AG Selection when we obtain the crystal.
Once you get the artifact for first time, you can select the next prize between the new artifact or the Gatling artifact.
If you plan to play the spinner, the best way is to acquire the pass, as we'll get a good number of attempts.

# Wavy Vibes
Additionally, we have a minigame similar to Flappy Bird, where we have to dodge obstacles to reach higher score. 
Get a higher score doesn't give us any reward, but it's a fun minigame to play and see who is the best one in the server.
