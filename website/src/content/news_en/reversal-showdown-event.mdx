# Servant Chess
Here we can unlock new servants to carry out our attacks. Each of them has different characteristics, both in base statistics and additional bonuses.
We must choose which servants to purchase to form our team. The different rarities of the servants will be unlocked as the days of the event pass.

# Reversal Showdown
Every day, 3 new difficulties for the event will be unlocked. We must complete each of them to unlock the next one. Depending on our performance in completing the level, we will receive 1, 2, or 3 stars.
To be eligible to receive all the rewards, we must complete all levels with 3 stars. Each level can be repeated as many times as necessary, so don't worry about trying new things.

Each level has its own rewards based on the star score obtained. Here we can see the objectives to achieve to obtain the different stars.

# Back on Track
Every day, a chain of rewards will be unlocked that we can claim in order. Some of them are free, and others are paid.
As a noteworthy point, in the last reward of each day, we can obtain the legendary toothpaste companion, ideal for warriors.

# Chess Mastery Pack
Here we can acquire the event currency in case we need to unlock more servants. It's not really necessary as we shouldn't have major problems completing the levels.
Each coin we retain at the end of the event will be automatically exchanged for 1,000 gold. Therefore, we could purchase the currency to obtain gold.
