# Introduction to Artifacts
The artifact is an essential part of our equipment, as it serves as our primary source of bonus to ignore the opponent's evasion.
This bonus will increase at certain artifact levels.
Moreover, artifacts provide us with bonuses to HP, ATK, and DEF that increase with each level.

# Artifact Enhancement
To upgrade the artifact level, we will need Divine Hammers.
These hammers can be obtained mainly in boost events.
We can also obtain them in temporary events, the __[Cross-Server Showdown](https://lom-academy.com/en/guides/game-modes/cross-server-showdown)__ shop, and clan activities.

# Artifact Enchantment
Runestones are usable in the artifactâ€™s enchantment tab and can provide amazing buffs for both PVE and PVP.

There are six enchantment slots where players can embed corresponding runestones to enhance th artifact's power.
Each runestone possesses a main afflix, and advanced runestonees coe with additional sub-afflixes.

Surplus runestones can be consumed to enhance other runestones, leveling up the main affix upon successful enhancement.
Every 4 levls, a runstone gains a new sub-affix or enhances an existing sub-affix (if theere are less than 4).

### Obtain Runestones
You can collect runestones from the Flame Temple dungeon.
This dungeon goes up to level 20 and provides higher rarity rewards the higher level you clear.
Once you clear level 20, just hit the sweep button to save yourself some time clearing it again.

### Runestone Types
There are three types of runestones, each with its own set bonus.
By combining 2 or 4 runestones of the same type, we will receive an additional bonus.

# Artifact Morph
Morphs are skins that provide a artifact effect and an extra ability.
The artifact effect accumulates alongside all the Morphs we have unlocked.
The artifact ability will only activate if we have the Morph in use.
