# Introduction
This game mode is primarily focused on open PvP/PvE between servers.
Each week, servers will be matched in groups of 4 and must battle each other to earn points and achieve the top position in the showdown.

During the time when portals to other servers are open, we can project our character onto any of the enemy servers.

<br/>


# Date and Duration
This event takes place once every week with a different matchup.
Portals are open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 to 22:00.

This event appears on new servers when they have been active for 15 days.

# Objectives
The main objective of this game mode is to score more points for your server than the other 3 servers.
To achieve this, it is necessary to attack other servers while not neglecting the defense of your own server.

At the start of the showdown, each server will have a Lightspawn on the Castle of Light map.
Attacking other servers' Lightspawn awards points.
If you deal the final blow, you will capture the Lightspawn for your server, earning your server 20% more points for each one.

Therefore, the main objective for players is to try to capture the Lightspawn for their server and defend them from enemy attacks.
To know where the Lightspawn are, we can look for the icons above the servers' banners.

# Map
Each server consists of five maps.
In the four outer maps (Candy Paradise, Lich Kingdom, Shroomie City, and Forgotten Ruins), we can find monsters of a difficulty level appropriate to the map level.
The Lightspawn are located on the central map.
