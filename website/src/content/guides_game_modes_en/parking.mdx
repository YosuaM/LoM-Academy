# Introduction
Parking is a simple but effective way to gain more HP, ATK, and DEF for your little shroomie. 
You have 8 hour spans to park 5 mounts (each with different reward bonuses, we will get into that later) 
and 1 extra slot for cross server parking (we will discuss that in another guide).

So lets start with the basics of Parking. If you go to your main screen which shows your gear and stage and such, 
at the bottom, click on the fourth icon, The Statue. In here, look for the section that says "Parking Wars", will be the middle right of your screen.

<br/>

Once you click on Parking Wars, you should have a screen similar to below:

<br/>

<br/>

Now that we know where it is, what does this do? How do we use this? Lets get into it step by step. 



<br/>
<br/>



# Parking Spot Management
In the center of the above screen, you have something called "Parking Spot Management". 
If you click on it, it will bring up a screen like below. 
On this screen, you can see all the buffs your decorations brings you, and others who park in your spots. 
The higher the buffs, the more likely you are to have people park. 

One here you can also see your passives that all the decorations give you as well that will be used in your main game. 
Parking Management section is how you decide if people pay you to park, who is allowed to pay you and who isn't, and how much they pay. 


Now a side note because ___alot___ of people get confused. 
In the second picture below, you will see the drop down menu for admittance. 
__This only decides who pays.__ 
This does not stop anyone specific from parking in your spots.

So, now your parking is set up, lets get into the next thing, shall we?

<br/>


# Parking
How do you go about parking in someone elses lot, and what do you do with people in your lot?

Lets start with parking in other lots first. To do this, if you look at the bottom of your parking lot, you will see a "find parking lot" button. 
You can click on that and it will bring up a list of parking lots from your friends list, as well as server spot which is public spots anyone can park in. 
All you have to do, is find someone who does not have the word "hot" above their name and click on the little shroom parking logo next to their name.

<br/>

![Server Spots](/assets/img/guides/game-modes/parking/parking_06.webp)

<br/>

___Side note:___ _anyone who has "hot" above their name, means they do not have any open spots for you to park in. 
If you see someone with "in cooldown" under their name, that means you just pulled from parking and cannot park there for a little bit._

<br/>

After clicking on the logo, you click on an empty spot and it will come up with the following pictures. 
If you do not pay, you cannot get the option to have protection of the person who owns that lot. 
If you do however pay, you now have an option for that protection.

<br/>

Repeat this with 5 different people (1 can be your own parking lot as well out of those 5) and you are set for 8 hours.

<br/>

While you are parking, you may get plundered. If this happens, you will only recieve the rewards for the time you were in that lot, 
BUT the person who plundered will take some coins as well. 


<br/>


Below is a list of the symbols you may see in parking management along with on your friends parking lot list.

# Plundering
What happens if someone is parking in your lot? 
Obviously you will receive parking coins if they chose to pay your admittance fee. 
If they do pay, you can click on that person in your lot and you will see the picture below. 

<br/>

<br/>

If they don't pay, you will see the second picture.

<br/>

<br/>

If you have someone not paying, you now have a couple options. 
You can choose to let them stay (but you can't help claim at 8 hours) or you can boot them out. 
If you choose to boot them out, you can attack them yourself or request help, which will be sent to world chat, for someone else to boot them. 
__multiple people__ can hit them and once they are booted out, you all will get some parking coins.

# Parking Coins and Remodeling Books
Every time you park, you will receive these items. 
Parking Coins are used in the shop to buy decorations and upgrades for these decorations to help boost your parking lot and your passives. 
__After initial first buy, you will not receive any more parking buffs, but your passives will still increase with each upgrade.__ 
These passives are used for parking.

Remodeling books are used to upgrade your mounts experience which in turn upgrades your ATK, HP and DEF bonuses. 

<br/>

<br/>

Along with being in your mount screen, you can also view how long you have parked your mount for that day. 
If you exceed 12 hours, you will start to get a decreased amount of rewards back. This, however, does reset the next day.
